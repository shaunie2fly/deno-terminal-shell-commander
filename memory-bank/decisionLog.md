# Technical Decision Log

## 2024-03-23: Service Integration Architecture

### Context
Need to implement robust service integration system for terminal shell project. Current implementation provides basic service registration but needs enhancement for production use.

### Decision
Created comprehensive service integration specification focusing on:
1. Enhanced service lifecycle management
2. Background task support
3. Continuous output handling
4. Robust error handling

### Rationale
- Current implementation lacks critical features for production use
- Need standardized approach for service development
- Must support async operations and background tasks
- Requires robust error handling and recovery

### Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: Core Implementation
   - Enhance service registry
   - Implement task manager
   - Create output management system
   - Develop error handling framework

2. Phase 2: Example Services
   - File system service
   - Process management service
   - Network service

### Success Criteria
- All services properly isolated
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Efficient background task management
- Clean service lifecycle management
- Comprehensive testing coverage

### Status
Implementation phase - Core components complete, implementing example services.

## 2024-03-23: Dependency Management Decision

### Context
Need to decide on dependency strategy for the project, particularly regarding the use of external libraries.

### Decision
Decided to avoid using external libraries where possible, preferring Deno's standard APIs and built-in capabilities.

### Rationale
- Reduce external dependencies
- Maintain better control over implementation
- Leverage Deno's built-in capabilities
- Simplify maintenance and updates
- Ensure consistent behavior across environments

### Implementation Impact
- Remove Cliffy dependencies
- Use Deno standard APIs for:
  - Process management
  - File system operations
  - Command handling
  - Terminal I/O

### Status
Active - Implementing services using Deno standard APIs

## 2024-03-23: Command Integration Documentation

### Context
Need clear documentation for adding new commands to ensure consistent implementation and maintainable codebase.

### Decision
Created comprehensive command integration guide detailing:
1. Command structure and registration
2. Subcommand support
3. Best practices for implementation
4. Testing guidelines

### Rationale
- Standardize command implementation
- Reduce technical debt
- Improve developer onboarding
- Ensure consistent error handling

### Status
Complete - Documentation available in memory-bank/specs/command-integration.md

## 2024-03-23: Process Status Streaming Architecture

### Context
Need to establish a standardized pattern for streaming status updates from async processes to the terminal shell. This includes progress reporting, error handling, and real-time status updates.

### Decision
Leverage existing OutputStream and OutputManager system with the following key features:
1. Buffered streaming with configurable limits
2. Transformer-based formatting
3. Event-driven status updates
4. Resource cleanup management

### Rationale
- Reuse existing output management infrastructure
- Provide consistent status reporting across all processes
- Enable flexible formatting through transformers
- Support both buffered and real-time updates
- Maintain clean resource management

### Alternatives Considered
1. Custom Process Status Manager
   - Pros: Purpose-built for process status
   - Cons: Duplicates existing stream functionality
   
2. Direct Terminal Output
   - Pros: Simpler implementation
   - Cons: No buffering, formatting, or error handling

3. External Status Service
   - Pros: Could handle distributed processes
   - Cons: Unnecessary complexity for local processes

### Success Criteria
- Real-time status updates without performance impact
- Consistent error handling and reporting
- Clean resource cleanup after process completion
- Flexible formatting options for different output types

### Status
Complete - Implementation guide available in memory-bank/specs/process-streaming.md
