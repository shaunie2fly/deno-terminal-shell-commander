# Decision Log

## ADR-001: UI Framework Selection
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need for a robust terminal UI framework for the shell interface.

### Options Considered
1. **deno_tui**
   - Pros: Active development, good documentation, component-based
   - Cons: Relatively new

2. **d_ui**
   - Pros: Simple API
   - Cons: Less established, fewer updates

### Decision
Selected **deno_tui** for the UI implementation.

### Rationale
- More active development community
- Better component system
- Recent updates and maintenance
- Better documentation

### Consequences
- Need to learn deno_tui specific patterns
- May need to handle component lifecycle carefully
- Better long-term maintainability

## ADR-002: Command Parser Selection
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need for a reliable command parsing system.

### Options Considered
1. **deno-cliffy**
   - Pros: Full-featured, well-documented, active development
   - Cons: Larger API surface to learn

2. **Custom Parser**
   - Pros: Tailored to needs
   - Cons: Development overhead, maintenance burden

### Decision
Selected **deno-cliffy** for command parsing.

### Rationale
- Mature and well-tested
- Supports complex command structures
- Active maintenance
- Good documentation

### Consequences
- Dependency on external package
- Need to manage version updates
- Reduced development time

## ADR-003: Project Structure
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need to establish a clear and maintainable project structure.

### Decision
Adopted Repository/Service pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── shell/        # Core shell implementation
├── commands/     # Command definitions
├── services/     # Service integration
├── ui/          # UI components
└── utils/       # Shared utilities
```

### Rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular and maintainable
- Follows Deno best practices
- Facilitates testing

### Consequences
- More initial setup time
- Better long-term maintenance
- Easier to extend
- Clear development guidelines

## ADR-004: Dependency Management
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need to configure project dependencies for UI and command parsing functionality.

### Decision
Update deno.json to include:
1. deno_tui for terminal UI
2. Additional deno-cliffy modules for command handling

### Rationale
- Essential dependencies for core functionality
- Follows Deno best practices using import maps
- Maintains consistent version management
- Leverages JSR registry for package management

### Consequences
- Need to update import maps in deno.json
- Must handle deno_tui integration carefully
- Version management responsibility
- Additional learning curve for team

## ADR-005: Terminal Interface Implementation Revision
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Initial implementation using deno_tui encountered compatibility and API issues. Need to revise the UI implementation approach.

### Decision
Switch to a simpler implementation using:
1. Deno's built-in stdin/stdout for terminal I/O
2. ANSI escape codes for basic formatting
3. Manual input handling

### Rationale
- More reliable implementation
- Better control over I/O
- Fewer dependencies
- Can refactor to use a TUI library later when ecosystem matures

### Consequences
- Need to implement basic terminal handling
- Simpler but more manual implementation
- More predictable behavior
- Easier to test and maintain initially

## Future Decisions Needed
1. Error handling strategy
2. Testing framework configuration
3. Documentation system
4. Service registration pattern
5. Background task management
6. Future TUI library selection
