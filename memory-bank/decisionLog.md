# Architectural Decision Log

## ADR-001: Project Structure and File Organization
* Status: Active
* Date: 2025-03-24

### Context
The terminal shell application needs to be converted into a reusable module that can be imported into other projects.

### Decision
We will adopt a streamlined architecture focusing on commands:

1. Core functionality organized into:
   - Shell management
   - Enhanced command system
   - UI components

2. Single @terminal-shell package with core modules

### Consequences
* Positive:
  - Simpler code organization
  - Easier to understand and maintain
  - Clear upgrade paths for users
  - Reduced complexity

* Negative:
  - Breaking changes required
  - Migration effort needed for existing code

## ADR-002: Enhanced Command System
* Status: Active
* Date: 2025-03-24

### Context
Current implementation separates commands and services, creating unnecessary complexity.

### Decision
Merge service functionality into an enhanced command system:

1. Commands can optionally include:
   - Lifecycle hooks (init, cleanup)
   - Health checking
   - State management
   - Subcommands

2. Move from global registry to instance-based command registry

### Consequences
* Positive:
  - Simpler mental model
  - Single system to maintain
  - More flexible command capabilities
  - Easier to document and understand

* Negative:
  - Migration needed for existing services
  - Need to carefully handle stateful commands

## ADR-003: Public API Design
* Status: Active
* Date: 2025-03-24

### Context
Need to define a stable, well-documented public API for the module.

### Decision
1. Create minimal public API focused on shell and command management:
   - Core Shell class with essential methods
   - Enhanced Command interface
   - Promise-based async operations
   - Event system for shell lifecycle

2. Use TypeScript for type safety and documentation

### Consequences
* Positive:
  - Clear, simple API surface
  - Type safety and better IDE support
  - Easier for users to understand
  - Better documentation

* Negative:
  - Breaking changes for existing code
  - Need to carefully manage interface evolution

## ADR-004: Testing Strategy
* Status: Active
* Date: 2025-03-24

### Context
Need comprehensive testing strategy for module functionality.

### Decision
1. Create focused test suites:
   - Unit tests for shell and command functionality
   - Integration tests for complex command scenarios
   - UI component tests
   - State management tests

2. Provide testing utilities:
   - Shell test helpers
   - Command test utilities
   - State management helpers

### Consequences
* Positive:
  - Better test coverage
  - Easier testing for consumers
  - Clear test patterns
  - Simpler test organization

* Negative:
  - Need to test stateful commands thoroughly
  - More complex state testing scenarios
