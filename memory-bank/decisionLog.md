# Technical Decision Log

## 2024-03-23: Service Integration Architecture

### Context
Need to implement robust service integration system for terminal shell project. Current implementation provides basic service registration but needs enhancement for production use.

### Decision
Created comprehensive service integration specification focusing on:
1. Enhanced service lifecycle management
2. Background task support
3. Continuous output handling
4. Robust error handling

### Rationale
- Current implementation lacks critical features for production use
- Need standardized approach for service development
- Must support async operations and background tasks
- Requires robust error handling and recovery

### Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: Core Implementation
   - Enhance service registry
   - Implement task manager
   - Create output management system
   - Develop error handling framework

2. Phase 2: Example Services
   - File system service
   - Process management service
   - Network service

### Success Criteria
- All services properly isolated
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Efficient background task management
- Clean service lifecycle management
- Comprehensive testing coverage

### Status
Implementation phase - Core components complete, implementing example services.

## 2024-03-23: Dependency Management Decision

### Context
Need to decide on dependency strategy for the project, particularly regarding the use of external libraries.

### Decision
Decided to avoid using external libraries where possible, preferring Deno's standard APIs and built-in capabilities.

### Rationale
- Reduce external dependencies
- Maintain better control over implementation
- Leverage Deno's built-in capabilities
- Simplify maintenance and updates
- Ensure consistent behavior across environments

### Implementation Impact
- Remove Cliffy dependencies
- Use Deno standard APIs for:
  - Process management
  - File system operations
  - Command handling
  - Terminal I/O

### Status
Active - Implementing services using Deno standard APIs
