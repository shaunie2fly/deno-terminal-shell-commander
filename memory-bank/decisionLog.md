# Decision Log

## ADR-001: UI Framework Selection
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need for a robust terminal UI framework for the shell interface.

### Options Considered
1. **deno_tui**
   - Pros: Active development, good documentation, component-based
   - Cons: Relatively new

2. **d_ui**
   - Pros: Simple API
   - Cons: Less established, fewer updates

### Decision
Selected **deno_tui** for the UI implementation.

### Rationale
- More active development community
- Better component system
- Recent updates and maintenance
- Better documentation

### Consequences
- Need to learn deno_tui specific patterns
- May need to handle component lifecycle carefully
- Better long-term maintainability

## ADR-002: Command Parser Implementation
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need for a reliable command parsing system.

### Options Considered
1. **deno-cliffy**
   - Pros: Full-featured, well-documented
   - Cons: External dependency, larger API surface, potential version conflicts

2. **Custom Parser**
   - Pros: Full control, tailored to needs, no external dependencies
   - Cons: Initial development overhead

### Decision
Selected **Custom Parser** implementation.

### Rationale
- Complete control over parsing behavior
- No external dependencies to manage
- Can optimize specifically for our use case
- Simpler to maintain long-term
- Better integration with our command system

### Consequences
- Need to implement custom parsing logic
- More initial development time
- More maintainable in long run
- Reduced external dependencies
- Better flexibility for future enhancements

## ADR-003: Project Structure
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need to establish a clear and maintainable project structure.

### Decision
Adopted Repository/Service pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── shell/        # Core shell implementation
├── commands/     # Command definitions
├── services/     # Service integration
├── ui/          # UI components
└── utils/       # Shared utilities
```

### Rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular and maintainable
- Follows Deno best practices
- Facilitates testing

### Consequences
- More initial setup time
- Better long-term maintenance
- Easier to extend
- Clear development guidelines

## ADR-004: Dependency Management
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need to configure project dependencies for UI and command parsing functionality.

### Decision
Minimize external dependencies:
1. Rely on Deno standard library where possible
2. Implement custom solutions for core functionality
3. Only use external packages when absolutely necessary

### Rationale
- Reduced dependency maintenance
- Better control over core functionality
- Simplified version management
- More predictable behavior

### Consequences
- More initial development work
- Greater control over implementation
- Easier to modify and extend
- Reduced version conflicts

## ADR-005: Terminal Interface Implementation Revision
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Initial implementation using deno_tui encountered compatibility and API issues. Need to revise the UI implementation approach.

### Decision
Switch to a simpler implementation using:
1. Deno's built-in stdin/stdout for terminal I/O
2. ANSI escape codes for basic formatting
3. Manual input handling

### Rationale
- More reliable implementation
- Better control over I/O
- Fewer dependencies
- Can refactor to use a TUI library later when ecosystem matures

### Consequences
- Need to implement basic terminal handling
- Simpler but more manual implementation
- More predictable behavior
- Easier to test and maintain initially

## ADR-006: Layout Management System
**Date:** 2025-03-22

### Context
Need to implement a flexible layout management system that supports scrollable output and fixed command input areas while working with the manual terminal handling approach.

### Decision
Implement a Buffer-Based Layout Manager with:
1. Virtual Buffer System
   - Maintain separate buffers for output and input areas
   - Track scroll position and viewport dimensions
   - Handle terminal resize events

2. Layout Components
   - OutputArea: Scrollable region for command output
   - InputArea: Fixed prompt region at bottom
   - StatusLine: Optional status information display

3. Layout Algorithm
   - Calculate dimensions based on terminal size
   - Reserve bottom N lines for input/status
   - Allocate remaining space to output area

### Rationale
- Compatible with manual terminal handling
- Efficient updates using virtual buffers
- Clear separation of output and input areas
- Flexible for future enhancements

### Consequences
- Need to implement custom buffer management
- Must handle terminal resize events
- More complex render logic
- Better control over layout updates

## Future Decisions Needed
1. Error handling strategy
2. Testing framework configuration
3. Documentation system
4. Service registration pattern
5. Background task management
6. Future TUI library selection
